            You may choose to give us personal information, such as your name and address or e-mail id

            We sometimes collect anonymous information from visits to our sites to help us provide
            better customer service. For example, we keep track of the domains from which people visit
            and we also measure visitor activity on Thriber’s website, but we do so in ways that keep
            the information anonymous. Thriber or its affiliates or vendors may use this data to
            analyze trends and statistics and to help us provide better customer service. We maintain
            the highest levels of confidentiality for this information; our affiliates and vendors
            follow the same high levels of confidentiality. This anonymous information is used and
            analyzed only at an aggregate level to help us understand trends and patterns. None of
            this information is reviewed at an individual level. If you do not want your transaction
            details used in this manner, you can either disable your cookies or opt-out at the
            download or request page.

          <p className="text-xl mb-6">
            Thriber recognizes the receipt, transmission or distribution of spam emails (unsolicited
            bulk emails) as a major concern and has taken reasonable measures to minimize the
            transmission and effect of spam emails in its computing environment. All emails received
            by Thriber are subject to spam checks. Any email identified as spam will be rejected with
            sufficient information to the sender for taking necessary action. With this measure,
            along with other technical spam reduction measures, Thriber hopes to minimize the effect
            of spam emails. Thriber reserves the right to reject and/or report any suspicious spam
            emails to the authorities concerned for necessary action, from time to time.
